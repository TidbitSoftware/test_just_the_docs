## Sea-Level Fingerprints (GRACE)

## Goals 

- Setup a ISSM-SESAW model with GRACE-based forcing
- Run the model to compute sea-level fingerprints

Go to `trunk/examples/SlrGRACE/` to do this tutorial.


## Mesh 
Set `steps=1` to create an unstructured global mesh. Choose `mindistance_coast`,
`mindistance_lan`, and `maxdistance` as you wish for generating a mesh. The nominal
parameters should generate the following mesh:

## GRACE loads 
Set `steps=2` to load GRACE-based estimate of water equivalent height (WEH) change for a chosen
month. Choose `year_month` as you wish. The nominal month is January 2007 and here is the load
model (cf. `steps=5` for plotting):

## Parameterization 
In the next step, you will load the Earth model. The nominal model is PREM; `lovenumbers` reads
the associated Love numbers. You will also have to set up some standard parameters regarding ice
sheets for passing the consistency.

## Solve Model 
In `steps=4`, you will choose the solid-Earth physics (e.g., gravitation, viscoelasticity, and
rotation) that you wish to consider. You may also request model outputs (e.g., sea level and bedrock
motion). You must set `masstransport` and `slc` flags on before solving the `transient`
model. See `steps=6` for running a model with multiple (transient) loads.

## Some Results 
Once the model run is completed, you may plot results. Some useful plotting scripts are located in
`steps=5` and `steps=7`. In the latter, you can also find a script to make an animation.
Here is an example result for January 2007:
